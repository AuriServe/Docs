# Upstairs People

Hi Elaine, 

It has been a little bit since I last contacted you in regards to the noise upstairs, and I'm sorry to say that the situation has not improved.

Whether it's blasting bass-heavy music, playing beer pong, running back and forth above our heads, or inexplicably gathering in their kitchen at 4 am to have a racous conversation, the upstairs tenants have something new and terrible in store for us every night, and recently their disturbances have been amplifying.

We have tried contacting them over texting. When we do, they either send a one word response of 'Ok,' and then barely change their volume, ignore us entirely, or straight up lie about being out when we can hear footsteps. We have tried ringing their doorbell. Both times we've done that, they've entirely ignored us, even though we know they heard us by the sudden silence that occurs for a few moments, before they continue with their madness.

It's safe to say that this situation has progressed to the point that it is unbearable. My roommates have taken to using noise cancelling headphones to study, I've been leaving the house as much as possible to avoid their noise, and none of us are getting the sleep and peace we should be in our own home. I didn't even want to return to Victoria because of the amount that the upstairs tenants impact my life.

This wasn't a problem last year, and I'm sure that my lack of complaint then can attest for that. But these new upstairs tenants have been so unreasonably awful that I and my roommates simply cannot bear it anymore. This situation needs to be resolved, one way or another.

I've taken to documenting their noisiness since I got back on the 10th. I'm linking an album of every time they've been unreasonable since then, which was 11 days ago. The sheer number of incidents since then should speak for itself.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
